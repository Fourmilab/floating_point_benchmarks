This is a version of the floating point benchmark which is
implemented in ATLAST:

my FORTH-like language for embedded systems and opening the
architecture of applications.

This implementation of the benchmark works only on 64-bit (2.x)
versions of ATLAST, where integers, pointers, and floating
point values all occupy one stack item.  It is possible to
convert it to work with a 32-bit version of ATLAST, but you
will have to use double-item operations for all of the floating
point values, as on a 32-bit system floating point numbers
occupy two stack and heap items.
