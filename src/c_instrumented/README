This directory contains an "instrumented" version of the
main C floating point benchmark.  It runs only a single
iteration, does not support internal trigonometric functions,
and has no user interface.

Its sole purpose is to provide a surface-by-surface intermediate
output trace of its calculations, which implementors of the
benchmark in other languages can use to compare with their
own intermediate results for the purpose of debugging.

You should not use this code for any other purpose.  Any
changes made to the main C benchmark, as long as they remain
compatible with the reference implementation output, should not
affect this program in any way.
