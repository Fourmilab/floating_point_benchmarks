The fbench_c64.bas program will run on BASIC V2 on the Commodore
64.  Unfortunately, this implementation of BASIC only provides
10 significant digits of accuracy for floating point
computations.  Consequently, the results of the computation do
not agree with the canonical results in the lower-order digits,
and thus do not pass the accuracy test required to be reported.

The result of running the program is as follows (I have
unwrapped long lines in the interest of readability).


                    FOCAL LENGTH   ANGLE TO AXIS
MARGINAL RAY         47.0947911     .0417847269
PARAXIAL RAY         47.0837215     .0417786483

LONGITUDINAL SPHERICAL ABERRATION: -.0110696256
  (MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE):            .0530674989 ACCEPTABLE

OFFENSE AGAINST SINE CONDITION (COMA): 8.95468984E-05
  (MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE):               2.5E-03 ACCEPTABLE

AXIAL CHROMATIC ABERRATION:    4.48255241E-03
  (MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE):        .0530674989 ACCEPTABLE

Commodore 64 BASIC has no PRINT USING statement, so we have to
live with the default formatting for floating point numbers.

As you can see, the most significant digits are correct, but the
limited precision induces errors in the least significant
digits.

The program is supplied in lower case ASCII, as that is what the
VICE emulator expects to be pasted into its console window.

The only thing that can be learned from this exercise is that
the benchmark is effective in detecting floating point
implementations which provide insufficient precision.
