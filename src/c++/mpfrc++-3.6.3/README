MPFR C++ was developed by Pavel Holoborodko and is available
from his Web page:

    http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/mpfr/
    
where the current version is always posted.  For convenience,
this release of FBENCH includes a copy of the 3.6.3 release
with which it was developed.  Please see the "copying.txt" file
for conditions of use and copying this software.

MPFR C++ requires that you have installed the GNU GMP:

    https://gmplib.org/
    
and MPFR:

    http://www.mpfr.org/
    
libraries.  These are included in or available for many popular
Linux distributions, so you may be able to install them on your
system with its package manager if they aren't already installed.

The entire definition is within the header file mpreal.h, so no
build is required: it is simply included within a program that
uses it.
