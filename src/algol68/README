This directory contains an implementation of the floating point benchmark
in Algol 68, conforming to the standard of the 1973 Revised Report.  This
program has been tested with the Algol 68 Genie system:

    http://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl/
    
which is a compiler/interpreter released under the GPL.  As far as I
can determine, this program uses only standard language features and
eschews extensions.

The program was ported from the Ada implementation, and the porting
process was completely straightforward.  I ran timing tests under
Ubuntu Linux, and after adjusting iteration counts to obtain a run time
of about five minutes, I ran three runs of the Algol 68 program with
an iteration count of 10,595,839 with timings in seconds of:
    298.696
    299.622
    301.673
for a mean time of 299.997 seconds.

For a control, I ran the C implementation of the benchmark for
157,894,736 iterations, yielding timings of:
    292.945
    293.858
    293.974
with a mean of 293.592 seconds.

The relative execution time of the benchmark in Algol 68 compared
to the C reference, then, is:

    (299.997 / 293.592) * (157894736 / 10595839) = 15.23
    
This should not be taken as representative of the potential
performance of Algol 68.  The Algol 68 Genie implementation is
intended as a reference implementation of the language with extensive
compile-time and run-time checking which makes it ideal for teaching
the art of programming.  There is no reason an Algol 68 implementation
optimised for maximum performance could not perform competitively with
similar modern languages such as Java.
