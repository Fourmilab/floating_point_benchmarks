This directory contains a complete re-implementation of the
Fbench program using the native features of Raku to create an
object-oriented solution along the lines of the native C++
version.  New Raku features such as classes and methods, typed
variables, enumerations, and constants are used where
appropriate to improve the comprehensibility of the code and
allow the compiler opprtunities to optimise the generated code.

It was developed and tested on Rakudo 2021.09 in September 2021.
