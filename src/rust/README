                     Rust Floating Point Benchmark
                           Development Notes

This directory contains an implementation of the Fourmilab floating
point benchmark in Rust,

    http://www.rust-lang.org/

Rust is a systems programming language currently under development.
It attempts to provide performance comparable to low-level
programming languages such as C and C++ while avoiding common
causes of crashes and security problems such as subscript and
pointer errors, dangling pointers, memory leaks, and multi-thread
race conditions.

As a language under active development, it is a moving target and
any program written for a given version may require modification
as the language and libraries evolve.  The program in this directory
was developed and tested using Rust 0.13.0 on an x86_64 machine
running Xubuntu kernel 3.13.0-32.  In order to compile and run
this program you must install the "rustc" and "cargo" programs on
your computer.  Installation instruction are found in the Rust Guide:

    http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html

Timing tests were run having built the program with the --release
option which enables code optimisation.  The Rust benchmark was run
five times on a quiescent machine with the iteration count adjusted to
yield a run time of about five minutes.  Then the process was repeated
for the reference C implementation.  Comparison of the mean run time
per iteration yielded a Rust run time of 1.077 as compared to C's run
time of 1.

The subdirectory "fbench" contains a complete Rust project for the
benchmark.  The source code is in the file fbench/src/main.rs.
