              FreeBASIC Floating Point Benchmark
                      Development Notes
                     November 4th, 2017

Timing tests:

    fbench.bas 127,172,531 iterations
        292.51
        292.33
        291.99
        291.75
        292.08
    Mean 296.54  2.3318 usec/iter

To compare this with the reference of C, I ran the C benchmark
as follows.

    fbench_ansi.c compiled with gcc -O3  166,051,660 iterations
        296.89
        296.37
        296.29
        296.76
        296.37
    Mean 296.536  1.7858 usec/iter

Run time ratio compared to C: 1.3057
