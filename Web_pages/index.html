There are many disadvantages to being a balding geezer.  In
compensation, if you've managed to live through the second half of the
twentieth century and been involved in computing, there's bearing
personal witness to what happens when a
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_84_7.html"
    target="_blank">technological transition</a>
goes into full-tilt exponential blow-off mode.  I'm talking about
Moore's Law (actually, more of an observation than a law, since it's
predicated on certain physical principles and can't go on
forever)&mdash;computing power available at constant cost doubling
every 18 months or so.  I've not only seen this happen,
I've&mdash;er&mdash;<a href="/documents/ferengi/palm/"
    target="_blank">profited</a>
from it; had the 80286-based IBM PC/AT
and its competitors not appeared when they did,
<a href="/autofile/" target="_blank">Autodesk</a>
would have been stillborn as too early to market or drowned out by
competitors as we arrived too late.

<p class="j">
When Moore's Law (or whatever) is directly connected to your career
and your bank account, it's nice to have a little thermometer you can
use to see how it's going as the years roll by.  This page links to
two benchmarks I've used to evaluate computer performance ever since
1980.  They focus on things which matter to me&mdash;floating point
computation speed, evaluation of trigonometric functions, and matrix
algebra.  If you're interested in text searching or database retrieval
speed, you should run screaming from these benchmarks. Hey, they work
for me.
